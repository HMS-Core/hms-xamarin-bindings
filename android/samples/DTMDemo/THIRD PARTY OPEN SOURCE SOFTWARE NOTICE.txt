You hereby warrant that you shall not configure the Codes or Services to collect any Restricted Data through the Services. Additionally, you agree that when it is known to you or when you should reasonably be aware that End User Data may be collected from Children, you shall configure the Codes and Services appropriately to ensure compliance with applicable children data protection and privacy laws (including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) – for example, by implementing an opt out from data collection when parental consent required by law is not obtained by you.
You are solely responsible for the correct implementation and configuration of the Codes and Services under applicable privacy or data protection laws. You will ensure that you have a lawful basis and/or right to collect and share such Customer Data as described in this Agreement. Without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, you shall: (A) provide appropriate notice to End Users which at a minimum: (i) complies with any applicable law or regulation; (ii) provides End Users with accurate disclosure of your privacy practices, including in relation to your use of third party services such as AppsFlyer, the type of information collected when using the Services, and how End User Data may be used by you and third parties (including AppsFlyer); and (B) obtain, where required by law, appropriate rights and/or consents: (i) to collect and use the End User Data and enable the collection, use and processing of End User Data by AppsFlyer pursuant to the terms of the Agreement (including specifically the AF Service Privacy Policy); and (ii) to place Collection Technologies (including by AppsFlyer) on the browsers or devices of End Users.

Without limiting any remedies available to AppsFlyer under this Agreement or applicable law, AppsFlyer reserves the right to suspend performance of the Services if it reasonably deems that Customer has not provided appropriate notice or obtained appropriate consent as required under this section.

If any End User Data collected through your use of the Service is deemed Personal Data as defined in the AppsFlyer Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) available at https://www.appsflyer.com/gdpr/dpa.pdf, then the terms and conditions set forth in the DPA shall apply to the use and processing of such Personal Data and shall be incorporated by reference into, and made an integral part of, this Agreement.
To the extent any Customer Data is deemed Personal Information (as such term is defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 et seq. (the “CCPA”)) and is subject to the CCPA, the parties agree that: (i) AppsFlyer shall be deemed a “Service Provider” and shall not be deemed “Selling”, both as terms are defined under the CCPA; (ii) AppsFlyer shall only use and process Personal Information obtained from your use of the Services (“Customer PI”) on your behalf and solely pursuant to the terms set forth in this Agreement; (iii) AppsFlyer shall not retain, use, or disclose Customer PI for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise expressly permitted under the Agreement; (iii) AppsFlyer shall not sell, rent, disclose, release, transfer, make available or otherwise communicate, Customer PI to a third party in exchange for any monetary or other valuable consideration, except as required to provide the Services or as otherwise expressly permitted under the Agreement; (iv) AppsFlyer shall assist you to fulfill your obligations under the CCPA and to respond to requests from data subjects exercising their rights under the CCPA (e.g. deletion, access), all in accordance with the CCPA requirements; and (v) AppsFlyer certifies that it understands the foregoing restrictions.
BILLING.
You shall be required to pay AppsFlyer all Subscription Package fees set forth in an Order Form. Unless different payment terms are specified in an Order Form, any amounts due shall be payable within 10 (ten) days of AppsFlyer’s issuance of the applicable invoice. Any Subscription Package fees unpaid by you by the due date shall thereafter bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum (or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less), during the period between the date the payment first becomes due and the date such amount is actually paid. Without derogating from any other remedies available to AppsFlyer under this Agreement or by law, if you have any outstanding debts in connection with any Services provided by AppsFlyer under any current or past Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form) and without limiting any other rights that may be available to AppsFlyer under the Agreement, AppsFlyer shall have the right to suspend or cease performance of the Services until such debt is paid. All amounts owed to AppsFlyer are non-cancellable and fees paid are non-refundable, except as explicitly otherwise stated in the Agreement.
AppsFlyer may use various billing service providers. When using such provider’s services, you agree to be subject to, and to comply with, the terms and policies of such provider. AppsFlyer shall not be liable and/or responsible for any acts or omissions of such billing providers.
All fees payable hereunder, do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT or other similar taxes or duties, including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, shall be borne and paid by you. For the avoidance of doubt, you shall not be responsible for any payment of taxes based on AppsFlyer’s net income.
INDEMNIFICATION.
You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend AppsFlyer, at your expense, from any and all third-party claims, actions, proceedings, and suits brought against AppsFlyer or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or Affiliates, and all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by AppsFlyer or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or Affiliates, arising out of, or relating to: (i) your breach of any terms of the Agreement; or (ii) your implementation and use of the Services in violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations.
AppsFlyer agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend you, at its expense, from any and all third-party claims, actions, proceedings, and suits brought against you or any of your officers, directors, employees, agents or Affiliates, and all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by you or any of your officers, directors, employees, agents or Affiliates, arising out of, or relating to, a claim that the Codes and/or Services infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AppsFlyer shall have no responsibility or liability for any claim to the extent resulting from, or arising out of: (a) use of the Codes or Services not in compliance with the Agreement, the Documentation or applicable law; (b) the combination of the Codes or Services with any other code, platform or services not provided by, or explicitly approved in writing, by AppsFlyer; (c) the modification of any Codes or Services by any party other than AppsFlyer or in any way not expressly permitted by the Documentation; or (d) the use of any Code that is not the most up-to-date Code as made available to you by AppsFlyer.
The obligations of either party to provide indemnification under this Agreement will be contingent upon the indemnified party: (i) providing the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that the indemnified party’s failure to notify the indemnifying party will not diminish the indemnifying party’s obligations under this Section, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure); (ii) cooperating fully with the indemnifying party (at the indemnifying party’s expense); and (iii) allowing the indemnifying party to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that no settlement may be entered into without the consent of the indemnified party if such settlement would require any action on the part of the indemnified party other than to cease using any allegedly infringing or illegal content or services. Subject to the foregoing, an indemnified party will at all times have the option to participate in any matter or litigation through counsel of its own selection at its own expense.
AGENCIES AND PARTNERS.
If you are an agency or a party representing, or providing services for the benefit of, a third party (“Agency Client“), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to act on behalf of, and bind to this Agreement, that Agency Client (and upon our request shall provide evidence thereof).

For such purpose, you may, through your configuration of the Services, direct AppsFlyer to share End User Data with, and receive data related to, End Users from Partners (“Shared Data“). Pursuant to the foregoing, you hereby grant AppsFlyer the right to share Shared Data with Partners and to obtain and process Shared Data from Partners.
