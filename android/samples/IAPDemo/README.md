HUAWEI In-App Purchases provides 3 types of product: consumable, non-consumable and auto-renewable subscription.

- Consumable : Consumables are product that can be consumed once. When consumed, it's depleted and can be purchased again.
- Non-consumable : Non-consumables can be only purchased once and do not expire.
- Auto-renewable subscription : Once purchased, Users can access to value-added functions or content in a specified period of time. The subscriptions will automatically renew on a recurring basis until users decide to cancel.

This demo project is an example to demonstrate the features of the Huawei In-App Purchases (IAP) Kit Xamarin Plugin.

Disclaimer: The demo only demonstrates the purchase procedure, and it does not have a real use of purchased products.
