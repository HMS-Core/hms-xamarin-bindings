HUAWEI Wallet Kit is an open capability that integrates Huawei's full-stack "chip-device-cloud" technologies to provide digital passes such as cards (including ID cards), coupons, tickets and keys on an integrated platform. It enables users to add their tickets, boarding passes, loyalty cards, coupons, gift cards, and other cards or passes on their mobile phones for convenient, anytime use.
The Xamarin SDK wraps the Android SDK with Managed Callable Wrappers through the usage of Android Bindings Library projects. It provides the same APIs as the native SDK.
